=head1 NAME

RPi::StepperMotor - Control a typical stepper motor with the Raspberry Pi

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use warnings;
    use strict;

    use RPi::StepperMotor;

    my $sm = RPi::StepperMotor->new(
        pins  => [12, 16, 20, 21],
        speed => 'half',            # optional, default
        delay => 0.01               # optional, default
        name  => 'tilt'             # optional, default undef
        expander => $expander_obj   # optional, default undef
    );

    $sm->cw(180);  # turn motor 180 degrees clockwise
    $sm->ccw(240); # 240 degrees the other way

    $sm->speed('full'); # skip every second step, turning the motor twice as fast
    $sm->delay(0.5);    # set the delay to a half-second in between steps

    $sm->name('new name');

    $sm->cleanup; # reset pins back to INPUT

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Control a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor through a ULN2003 driver chip, with the option
to run it from an MCP23017 GPIO Expander.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Instantiates and returns a new L<RPi::StepperMotor> object.

Parameters:

    pins => $aref

Mandatory, Array Reference: The ULN2003 has four data pins, IN1, IN2, IN3 and
IN4. Send in the GPIO pin numbers in the array reference which correlate to the
driver pins in the listed order.

    speed => 'half'|'full'

Optional, String: By default we run in "half speed" mode. Essentially, in this
mode we run through all eight steps. Send in 'full' to double the speed of the
motor. We do this by skipping every other step.

    delay => Float|Int

Optional, Float or Int: By default, between each step, we delay by C<0.01>
seconds. Send in a float or integer for the number of seconds to delay each step
by. The smaller this number, the faster the motor will turn.

    expander => Object

Optional, L<RPi::GPIOExpander::MCP23017> object instance. Send one of these
objects in, and we'll run the stepper motor from that instead. The pins
parameter still needs to be sent in, but will be in the limit C<0-15>, the four
pins attached from the expander to the motor, in the order of C<IN1> through
C<IN4>.

=head2 cw($degrees)

Turns the motor in a clockwise direction by a specified number of degrees.
Clockwise is defined when the shaft of the motor is facing you/upwards.

Parameters:

    $degrees

Mandatory, Integer: The number of degrees to turn the motor in a clockwise
direction.

=head2 ccw($degrees)

Turns the motor in a counter-clockwise direction by a specified number of
degrees. Counter-clockwise is defined when the shaft of the motor is facing
you/upwards.

Parameters:

    $degrees

Mandatory, Integer: The number of degrees to turn the motor in a
counter-clockwise direction.

=head2 cleanup

Sets all pins back to INPUT mode. This should be called near the end of your
script.

Takes no parameters, has no return.

=head2 delay($seconds)

This is the amount of time to delay between each step of the motor. It defaults
to C<0.01> seconds.

Parameters:

    $seconds

Optional, Float|Int: The number of seconds (or fraction of seconds) to delay
between each step of the motor.

Returns:

The currently set delay time.

=head2 name($name)

When you have more than one servo in an application, it may be useful to give
each motor its own name for printing purposes.

Parameters:

    $name

Optional, String. The name you want to give the servo.

Return: The name if one has been set, otherwise C<undef>.

=head2 speed($speed)

The motor can operate in 'half' speed mode (where all eight steps are used) or
'full' speed mode, where every second step is skipped. 'half' speed mode is more
accurate, but 'full' speed mode is faster.

Parameters:

    $speed

Optional, String: Send in 'full' to skip every second step rendering the motor
twice as fast. The other option is 'half', which is the default setting.

Returns:

The currently set speed.

=head1 STEPPER BINARY CLI TOOL

I've included a very simple binary that is installed with this distribution
that performs all of the functions in the module easily from the command line.

=head2 Usage

    stepper <direction> <degrees> [speed]

=head2 Example

    # turn clockwise 180 degrees at normal (half) speed

    stepper cw 180
   
    # turn counter-clockwise 240 degrees at full speed

    stepper ccw 240 full
